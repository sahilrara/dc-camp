                    <p class="fs-16 fw-semibold text-black">1. Grief Night</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black "> &nbsp; I sat in a narrow trench, covered with piles of
                        wood,
                        to serve as a bulwark. There is only a small shield on the front for crawling in and out in an
                        emergency. This pit is L-shaped. Inside, it was dark and there was no air as wide as the outside
                        atmosphere. There are many king crabs in the woods. Near my feet are mounds of red ants piled up
                        to make their living quarters. On the other side of the shed, I saw bags of rice and some
                        clothes, all piled up here and there. As my mother was terrified of the shootings between the
                        national army and the guerrillas of the Khmer Rouge blood war alone, she kept throwing in as
                        much as she could. Terrified, my hands are numb, but the service is wrapped tightly in a krama,
                        I do not know what it is. My head is all ground when there is the sound of artillery Shaking,
                        trembling, falling from three piles of wood like raindrops. My father always sprinkled soil on
                        my head, saying softly, "May the earth save my children from all evil." Sweaty clothes, parents,
                        siblings, brothers and sisters enter this room together. Everyone was talking to each other in
                        frightening whispers and their ears were listening to the gun. Once heard from the north. Once
                        heard from the west, then correspond incessantly. I heard it from time to time, terrified,
                        stabbed in the abdomen and chest. The smell of earth, the smell of the body of each person in
                        this pit, even though it was dark and I could not see each other, but it made me know who I
                        really was. The sound of gunfire was over for a while, but no one in the security pit dared to
                        leave. Every day, as always, I would hide in this pit when there was a gun attack by a group of
                        Cambodian warriors. In the long run, I do not want to get out of this pit, I want to live in
                        peace with a family, I want nothing but peace. I was in the pit often. This seems to keep me
                        warm, avoid fear and protect me in every way. It was getting darker and darker, and the sound of
                        wailing was heard again, instead of the sound of gunfire, accompanied by the sound of dogs
                        chasing from the northern end of the village to the front of my house. I listened in silence,
                        barely daring to breathe. My heart was pounding and my chest was pounding like I was about to
                        burst. My feelings are really scared, find nothing comparable. My father spoke to me and those
                        in the pit with concern. He told my mother and my relatives and I, who were in the pit, not to
                        leave until he returned. Then he crawled out of the pit, crawling through the banana plant near
                        the milk tree. Close to the barn to watch for the arrival of this cry. His actions are like the
                        emergencies of the previous days. He understood everything clearly, so he came back and told me
                        and the people in this pit to come out and pack as soon as possible to leave the house in
                        Krasang village all night. Residence in Chongkal district according to their evacuation. I
                        jumped out of the pit and hurried to get some things and put them on the cart. My father brought
                        oxen to cart. My mother with one hand, my brother with one hand, holding a space lamp, walking
                        in front of a cart, illuminating the road. The people in the village called for a meeting in
                        front of my house and drove away in the dark of night. I looked at the house many times, but
                        because the night was too dark, the cart drove away until I could no longer see my house. My
                        tears flowed unconsciously in the dark night, no one saw or heard. His actions are like the

                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black"> &nbsp; Every day I cry in my heart, because I am very
                        sad about this chronic war. I often ask unanswered questions, asking myself countless times why
                        there is a war? Why do they want to attack others, even though others want to be like
                        themselves? Does the nation's prosperity really need to go to war to kill each other? What I
                        want is not like this, I want to see the life of the people, peace, a prosperous country, people
                        know how to love each other, help each other, be united as a brotherhood in this land of
                        Sovannaphum.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black"> &nbsp;War brings destruction, loss of property, loss of
                        life.
                        What people are always ambitious, not satisfied, and everyone is always divided because of
                        greed, but with their own power, endless desires in this love cycle. At any given time,
                        confrontation has never progressed through violence. It hardens and shortens the life of the
                        human race and causes disunity, affecting the Khmer culture, traditions and customs, especially
                        the loss of patriotic will in the name of Khmer resin blood. Structures in villages, districts,
                        pagodas, schools, hospitals across the country were destroyed. The isolated people of the city
                        and the countryside, who used to live happily with their personal freedoms and enjoy their
                        livelihood in this peaceful country, are now homeless, wandering around at the behest of people
                        like me. The chariot kept going, even though it was getting dark in the middle of the night. I
                        sat drowsily on the cart, even though the dirt from the wheels of the cart came to water on my
                        body, I do not seem to care that my big problem, but what is my problem now is the life and
                        future of I have to drift to where no one knows and can not explain.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp;In the future, I, as well as the people in the
                        village
                        who are living happily with their families and homes, quickly change into a homeless person for
                        a short time, leaving their fields and gardens floating around at night. Conspicuous. This is
                        because the cause of the war that arises from the desire for destructive power, but the nation
                        itself is not afraid to pity the lives of innocent people a bit.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black"> &nbsp;This autumn, the weather at night is getting
                        colder, I
                        am shivering like a sparrow in the rain. The smell of ripe rice wafted from the rice fields near
                        the road from Krasaing village through the north of Chhouk village to Khnar village, Kork Spean
                        village and Preah Nokor village towards Chong Kal district town. The wind is blowing tonight,
                        the sound of dogs barking because the owner is lost, the sound of stealing from the forest
                        behind the herd of travel. This sound made my heart ache even more. Cows walk, eat grass, and do
                        not stop. Traveling all night until dawn, I finally arrived in Chongkal.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black"> &nbsp;Every morning, my father used to go to harvest
                        rice in
                        the south of Krasaing village with the villagers who helped him harvest one by one, but this
                        time he came to live in the pagoda of Chong Kal district. The rest of my father, as well as all
                        the villagers, was not filled and harvested as before, but was left completely in Krasang
                        village. Life as a farmer is nothing happier than harvesting rice that is ripe across the
                        fields. I used to get up early in the morning to cook instead of my parents' hands and feet to
                        wrap them up for them to go out to harvest rice, so I was born and sat on the cart, refusing to
                        leave. I am still not satisfied with the evacuation activities. Feelings of confusion. It seems
                        like a nightmare. Everywhere I looked, I saw carts and people stopping at the pagoda. Everyone
                        worries in their minds, can't solve it.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp;I stayed in Chongkal district for one night and
                        was
                        evacuated by the mobile team leader to Trom village, Srey Snom district, Siem Reap province,
                        with the children in the village my age. Withdrawal this time I went alone. As for my family,
                        they were left to travel partly to Trom village, Srey Snom district, Siem Reap province as well.
                        But this time, they split up, taking the children on separate trips, and the family traveling
                        with the other party. My father handed me a scarf and told me to take it with me and use it in
                        case of an emergency. Do not throw it away because it is your life. I reached for the gift and
                        hugged it with excitement. I bowed down in tears, bowed my head to say goodbye to my father,
                        accompanied by gratitude to my benefactors. At the same time, the leader of the mobile team and
                        a group of young people arrived and escorted us about thirty people to wait for the water
                        elephant ride. Transport sand for construction from Kork Sramor village to Kralanh district.
                        After a while, three cars came and we had to split into three groups and get in that car. The
                        water elephant swam as fast as its name implies. The car leads to Ochik Bridge, a bridge on the
                        border of two provinces, Siem Reap and Oddar Meanchey.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black"> &nbsp;The sound of an explosion, the sound of an
                        earthquake
                        shaking the earth near the base of the bridge, the smoke billowing in the air. The sand buried
                        my head, I could hardly move, the car stopped and did not move forward immediately. The sound of
                        screaming like a sparrow breaking the nest into my eyes, I can not find anything, my hand one
                        hand wrapped around the other hand, searching for friends riding together on the sand dunes,
                        scrambling to find all the numbers. Oh! Thanks to the earth, he really helped the innocent lives
                        of these children, you seem to know that all children are the strength of a strong nation to
                        continue to take turns to take care of this country. Suffering from this dark regime. Wrapping
                        my krama torn, I knelt down, raised my hands in remembrance of the merits of my parents, the
                        most powerful way to protect my child's life in this time of emergency. I wiped the soil from
                        the bundle and looked at the torn spot with tears in my eyes. I could clearly see with my own
                        eyes that it was a small, thick print, and that there was a bullet hole, but it did not reflect.
                        Oh! My life, you have saved me from death and life, have escaped this evil, and without you, my
                        body would have been reflected by this explosive metal. My body, my fresh blood, it will fall in
                        line with this beautiful earth in vain. Tai Kong Lan and his team riding in front all died. The
                        mobile captain ran to us. Seeing that there was no problem, he asked us to hurry up and get
                        behind the other two cars without any problems to continue our journey. I unpacked my torn car
                        and got into the car again</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp; The journey can not be stopped, passing from one
                        village to another village to Kralanh district. At first, the captain of the mobile team told me
                        to evacuate to Trum village, but since the mine exploded and needed to transport the sand
                        quickly, we used the children to come and drop the sand quickly. That is why we were forced to
                        continue to come to Kralanh district, different from the old destination. The sky is dark and
                        the sand truck has just arrived in Kralanh district. The truck left to go back to transport
                        sand, but they did not let me go, they left me and other friends waiting to pick up the sand and
                        drop it in Kralanh district for five nights and five days. I work hard, never neglect. How to
                        keep myself alive, no matter how hard the work, go through the cold, I never complain a word,
                        only bite the mouth, stress, patience, grinning, work all day and night.</p>
                    <p class="fw-semibold fs-16 text-black">2. Evacuation camp</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp;The first evacuees to settle in Chongkal district
                        were only three villages, including Krasaing, Prasat and Khnar. Now the evacuation process
                        continues to Trom village, Srey Snom district, Siem Reap province. My family was traveling on
                        the road and saw my car damaged by a landmine. They were shocked. He was worried about me, lest
                        there be any danger to me. My family and all the evacuees came to live in the house with all the
                        Trum villagers, which required one evacuation family to stay with one Trom family.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">All the villagers in Trom village were forced by the
                        cooperative to harvest rice far from this village to Rumdeng …… village, and some mobile groups
                        were taken to close the fields and build dams in Trapeang Sreng. And at Ang Trapeang Thmor as
                        well. No matter where you are, no matter how hard you try, no one eats. Eating in groups, always
                        in groups, always packing one dish at a time. Then, after pouring sand for fifteen days in
                        Kralanh district, one night I arrived at the evacuation camp in Trom village. My other friends
                        and I were sent home by the president of the cooperative one by one because we did not know
                        where our family was. On a quiet night in Trom village, all the mobile women take a shower and
                        then go to get food from the chef at the southern end of the village to refresh themselves in
                        the evening. By the way, our dinner is no longer in the evening, it is at night almost every
                        day. I take my father's polish Give me to use when necessary to put rice and food as needed.
                        This mobile group eats only at night, sometimes only potatoes, sometimes only rice, no soup,
                        sometimes only porridge… and sometimes bitter or raw…. Also, I do not complain, I can only
                        swallow my stomach and live on.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black"> From day to day, I always see people planning to manage
                        people in the work of cooperatives in the village is different. I see them divided into four
                        aspects: children, youth, middle-aged and elderly. A group of children were asked to walk around
                        collecting cow dung to dig compost. Youth groups are organized into mobile groups to close the
                        fields or harvest rice. The middle age group is assigned to lead and work in each team. As for
                        the elderly, they stay at home to watch the children of the team who are sent to harvest rice in
                        the light…, where they each take care of three or five small children. As for the food, all the
                        groups do not require anyone to cook or cook themselves, they have a chef to manage this work.
                        As soon as it was time for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I heard the bells ringing to signal to
                        the entire team to line up for the food.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">After working hard at the responsibilities assigned to
                        me by the president of the cooperative, I never had enough time to rest. As a young girl with a
                        lot of work experience, I really had a hard time getting what I got from this assignment. All
                        the work, it was really big beyond my physical strength and ability. But in order to keep my
                        life together, to reunite my parents, my siblings, and for my beloved country, all the heavy and
                        light things became normal, and I decided to do it all, even if I had to do it twice, in the
                        middle or in the middle. Hot days, rain, thunder, lightning. At the age of 15, I am very fit,
                        but I will have a beautiful body, bright colors, and I am studying and living comfortably in my
                        simple shelter, and I should not be drifting in the middle of the day and night like that. Is
                        this my work from the past or did it cause my life to face all these things? Day and night there
                        is no opportunity to talk and live with a warm family. No, it is not my bad result, because the
                        people of one village, one country is also sad about this. Now, even during the festival season,
                        no one dares to follow the tradition, because this regime has closed all the freedoms of the
                        people so that no one can worry about this festival. On the other hand, there are no monks in
                        the pagoda because they have already decapitated the monks. Oh! Cambodia, you are experiencing
                        like a slogan, "Culture disappears, nation dissolves, culture multiplies, nation rises." When
                        will you be able to recover from this terrible plague? Every citizen works like an unforgiving
                        animal, what life does not fail? Cambodia, you are experiencing like a slogan, "Culture
                        disappears, nation dissolves, culture multiplies, nation rises." When will you be able to
                        recover from this terrible plague? Every citizen works like an unforgiving animal, what life

                    <p class="fw-semibold fs-16 text-black">3. Bacterial disease</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp; My body is thin, emaciated, dry, black, and I
                        don't understand. Every day I go to work sick because of hard work, fatigue and malnutrition.
                        Ever since I found out I had gout, I have not seemed happy about my job. On the other hand, I am
                        no longer afraid of the threat from the Pol Pol Black Shirts. They always used harsh words to me
                        that I was a hypocrite, on the other hand, they kept teasing me over and over again that I was
                        mentally ill. My parents were very upset to see me sick. But they never let me see that he was
                        upset because of me. He made a fresh face, smiled at me and always encouraged me.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp; Every night during the harvest season, the wind
                        from the north is very cold, but my body is as hot as a mountain. The fire is different from
                        normal people. My father always lit incense and prayed to the sacred objects that protect the
                        territory of Cambodia. Especially at the Brahma Kel temple, the bridge tells the direction,
                        which is the cultural heritage, the historical history of the glorious ancient Khmer people, to
                        help nurture and take care of me so that I can recover quickly from my illness. He always went
                        to fetch water from all the temples and bridges to bring me to drink with my body, hoping that
                        the water would help me to be healed as I wished. He put a handful of water in my scrotum for me
                        to drink and then put it on my stomach to cool down. My mother fed me porridge with love and
                        affection for me. Neighbors always bring no one to visit me, never break. All of their energy
                        pushed my spirits up more and more day by day until I was relieved. This polished baby, when I
                        was in trouble, I was always there for him, he was my life.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp; Your body is getting colder, and your face is
                        getting brighter, and the powers that be are really helping my son to get well, and my father is
                        talking to me with hope. I smiled at him excitedly, even though I was lying on the mat, still
                        not comfortable. My mother reached under my neck and lifted me to sit. Wherever I look, I see
                        all yellow, nothing as beautiful as before. Fatigue is not far from me, I try to eat more
                        porridge to make my health stronger. My father sat next to me, holding a towel soaked in water,
                        wiping my hands, feet and body for me.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp; Today I ate a lot of porridge, my daughter's
                        mother. My mother, she spoke to me. I smiled at him with a sad look on my face. My father kept
                        pouring water on me until I felt the cold pull the blanket over him and he stopped wiping me.
                        With the love and high dedication of this parent and the villagers, close relatives and friends
                        who took this medicine a little bit, that medicine a little bit, based on the experience that
                        they used to treat patients, showing the effectiveness of those drugs that they claim. That it
                        is very effective, let me use it and look at it. Because it is a traditional medicine used in
                        combination with milk, tiger bones, animal skins, animal skins, shells, animal skins, wood
                        roots, bark, nuts, fruits, some of which are poisonous, but it is time to use them to treat it.
                        Has also become a potent medicine. They rubbed the stones with a stone. I put water in it and
                        left it for me to drink as a medicine. I observe that some drugs are just brushed once, some are
                        brushed twice, some three times…. Depending on the type of disease, such as antipyretics,
                        headaches, dizziness…. And so on.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp; Oh! The heart of parents, no matter how young or
                        old they are, he always takes care of their children with love, never disappears. Whether you
                        have a family or become a dignified person, your child will always be a boy or a girl.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp;I miss my homeland very much, especially my cats
                        and dogs. So they live in poverty and do not know what food is. They used to have owners, always
                        taking care of them. My father handed me a small bottle of kale with ink in it. I will eat
                        porridge and take this medicine for a while so that I can be strong and recover quickly, because
                        we will be back to our hometown in five days. I just heard my father finish, I immediately
                        received the baby, drank a little bit of ink, and my face suddenly smiled with a gesture of
                        friendliness different from any other day, I was really happy Nothing compares.</p>
                    <p class="fw-semibold fs-16 text-light-black">4. Soul of life</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp; The soul seems to fly back into my body and I
                        have to try to eat food to be healthy as soon as possible, especially to see the landscape of my
                        village again in peace. My only wish is to see a peaceful nation, a prosperous people, a
                        prosperous life, and a sense of unity as a whole, together to preserve the cultural heritage,
                        traditions, and build new buildings like our ancient ancestors that he built and Remains include
                        many ancient temples on the land of Sovannaphum.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp;The livelihood of the people at this time, despite
                        their hard work day and night, almost no holidays, they do not have the right to own it, and
                        they do not have the right to cook their own food and water, they just have to accept it. Take
                        the soup from all the same chefs. At lunchtime, bells are rung, and everyone is invited to line
                        up for a plate of food.</p>

                        and do things normally. And my parents and all the neighbors were happy to see me healed and in
                        good health. The hearts of our Cambodian people are very generous with each other. Everyone
                        always shares cakes, food, meat, food to each other, never break. In particular, this shared
                        culture has become a strong Khmer mindset that makes long-term friendships the most united.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp;The time has come for me and my family and all the
                        villagers to go back to their hometown with happy faces. I can clearly see from the hearts of
                        all the people that they are willing to live in their own house, no matter how small or big the
                        house is, they are always satisfied with what they have, rather than living in a big, high-rise
                        house, but it belongs to them. They. And they also struggle because self-serving is happier than
                        living in a dark world that makes them live on food but lose all these freedoms.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp; Just a few months ago, some of the ripe rice fell
                        to the ground, some were burned to the ground, and some of it grew back like new rice. Birds,

                        left.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp; In the village there are houses but no people,
                        there are still roads, but no one walks, the grass grows and becomes a city of mosquitoes and
                        amphibians happily. Palm trees, palm trees, mango trees, jackal trees and some tall milk trees
                        were torn down to the ground caused by bullets fighting in the bloody war between Khmer and
                        Khmer.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp;My poor hometown, I never thought I would be able
                        to see you again. I wish I could live with you, not leave you with the war, even if I have to
                        die, let me die here with you. And my biggest wish is to have peace, to have the opportunity to
                        study, to learn knowledge, to contribute to the development of the country out of poverty,
                        especially the fire of war is also scary.</p>
                    <p class="fw-normal fs-16 text-light-black">&nbsp; My mother went to prepare the house and light
                        incense and pray at the village where the house was kept. He told the housekeeper that the
                        landlord had returned and wished him a happy and prosperous life. I look at my mother silently.
                        My father was a hard worker, and when he saw that the house was full of weeds, he immediately
                        took a machete and a hoe and cleared it. I help collect the garbage and burn it properly. I feel
                        sorry for my dog ​​and cat. They live here without a landlord for a while, do not know that they
                        have made food, just see the owner come home like this, they run to hug and cry in front of us,
                        as if to say that they miss They are very worried, they are very miserable…. I knelt down with
                        both hands clasped under their chests, lovingly embracing them. My uncontrollable tears flowed
                        with excitement at their intimacy and sincerity. Although animals, but they seem to be a family
                        member, so I say that one of them, whether they understand or not, means that from now on you
                        will live happily with me and my family. Let us stop leaving you and as long as our lives are
                        not dissolved, you will live happily in my family circle. In particular, this nation will
                        gradually regain peace.</p>
