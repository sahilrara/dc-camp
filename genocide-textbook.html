            DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEA (1975-1979)</h1>
          <p class="para text-light-black line-h-166 mb-2">The Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam) is
            proud to announce the publication of the second edition of its history textbook, The History of
            Democratic Kampuchea. The second edition includes new chapters that discuss post-genocide
            justice as well as new information and stories that have come out in proceedings and decisions
            of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). The second edition provides
            readers with not only historical information about the Khmer Rouge regime, but also basic facts
            and concepts about the establishment, organization, and work of the ECCC.
          </p>
          <p class="para text-light-black line-h-166 mb-2">As the authors (Pheng Pong-Rasy, Sopheak Pheana and
            Christopher Dearing) state in their book, “[t]he ECCC’s judgments helped the Cambodian people
            and the world come to a better understanding of what led up to and ultimately occurred during
            the Khmer Rouge regime.” With this book, it is hoped that some of this information can now be
            incorporated into new classes and lessons for Cambodian students and the public.
          </p>
          <p class="para text-light-black line-h-166 mb-5">None of this would be possible without the
            incredible support of a number of important stakeholders. DC-Cam would like to thank the
            Cambodian Government for initiating and supporting the teaching of the Cambodian Genocide since
            the early 1980s. The Government’s continued support for the education of the younger generation
            has been crucial to the country’s future.
          </p>
          <img class="mb-4  w-100" src="./assets/img/png/genicode-textbook-img-2.png" alt="">
          <p class="para text-light-black line-h-166 mb-2">I would also like to thank the Ministry of
            Education, who has been a long-time partner with DC-Cam. I hope this book will help countless
            teachers and students study the country’s dark past
          </p>
          <p class="para text-light-black line-h-166 mb-2">Thank you to the donors, both those who
            specifically funded the publication of this book as well as those who provide general support to
            DC-Cam. Funding for this book was generously provided by Deutsche Gesellschaft für
            Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, the Civil Peace Service, the Federal Ministry for
            Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), and the Swedish International Development Agency
            (Sida). DC-Cam would also like to thank the United States Agency for International Development
            (USAID), which continues to provide generous support to DC-Cam’s work.
          </p>
          <p class="para text-light-black line-h-166 mb-2">Last, but not least, DC-Cam would like to thank the
            five million Khmer Rouge survivors. Their ongoing effort to re-tell their stories ensures this
            history will not be forgotten. This book is dedicated to them.
          </p>
          <p class="para text-light-black line-h-166 mb-4 pb-lg-3">The history of the Khmer Rouge must belong
            to
            each
            and every person in Cambodia, not only as a matter of right, but also obligation. A vibrant
            democracy depends on the equal rights of all citizens to fully participate in its affairs;
            however, citizens bear an equal responsibility to be informed stakeholders. A citizenry that is
            ignorant, dismissive, or unappreciative of its past only invites the hardships and inhumanity
            that plagued the generations before. Cambodia’s future depends on education, both as a civil
            right as well as an individual moral obligation. This book will give students and the public one
            more tool to realize these benchmarks of individual and collective maturity.

            on. But we cannot progress — much less reconcile with ourselves and others — until we have
            confronted the past and understand both what happened and why it happened. Only with this
