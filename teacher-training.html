           <p class="para text-light-black line-h-166 mb-2">The Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam)’s
             Democratic
             Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge)
             history
             education programme is grounded in local culture and it is participant (or student) centered.
             Using the history of Democratic Kampuchea as a starting point, the DK history education
             programme challenges participants with a wide variety of learning and cultural exchange
             activities that promote dialogue, a diversity of cultural expressions, and process-oriented
             learning outcomes. DC-Cam frames its historical content within the stories of people, both in
             written and oral narrative. Civil Parties, as well as local leaders, villagers, and elders are
             encouraged to share their understanding of DK history. Moreover the DC-Cam history textbook,
             teacher’s guidebook, and other materials provide a portfolio of stories that cover the spectrum
             of humanity and inhumanity. Participants are exposed to a wide range of narratives covering
             perpetrator, victim, bystander, and ‘upstander’ experiences.</p>
           <p class="para text-light-black line-h-166 mb-2">In sharing and discussing these experiences,
             participants are able to consider alternative viewpoints, historical understandings, and
             cultural perspectives of DK history. In addition, with a nod to Howard Gardner’s Multiple
             Intelligences Theory, participants are given the opportunity to express their opinions and
             knowledge using a variety of different modalities, which encourage a diversity of cultural
             expressions. The DK history education programme offers activities spanning the entire spectrum
             of culture in Cambodia: from writing/interpreting a song, poem, or story, to painting a
             picture, assembling a collage, or participating in and interpreting a theatrical performance.
             Altogether these modalities not only ensure that the spectrum of learners is accommodated but a
             diversity of cultural expressions is promoted. With DC-Cam’s Teacher’s Guidebook, the teaching
             guide for teachers, the student-centered approach will be integrated into the classroom
             teaching. With this new student-centered approach, students will be able to develop
             self-learning, critical thinking, independent inquiry, high-order thinking skills, critical
             reading strategies, self-reflection, and problem solving skills among many other
             process-oriented outcomes that are necessary for the intellectual development of the students.

           <p class="para  text-light-black line-h-166 mb-2 mt-lg-2">DC-Cam views teacher trainings as the
             vehicle for providing a direct benefit to the professional development of teachers, enhanced
             learning environment for students, and a mechanism for stimulating inquiry, dialogue, and
             reflection amongst community members on what happened and why during the Democratic Kampuchea
             regime.
           </p>
           <p class="para  text-light-black line-h-166   mb-2">The teacher trainings meet these objectives by
             blending local and foreign educational models and utilizing both large and small-group
             settings. In large groups, teachers are exposed to intensive lectures on the history of
             Democratic Kampuchea and the general practice points for teaching the history. In this sense,
             the teachers are taught using local methods that center on teacher-centered learning.
           </p>
           <p class="para  text-light-black line-h-166   mb-2">In addition, teachers learn how to manage large
             classes using student-centered learning approaches. The instruction pulls from theories in both
             andragogy and pedagogy. In large group settings (20-100 teachers), teachers observe the faculty
             trainers explaining the history and different methods for teaching the history, then faculty
             trainers model these lessons (using the teachers as pseudo-student/participants) while giving
             practice points throughout the mock lesson. After the model lesson, the teachers are given an
             opportunity to ask questions about any confusing areas of the historical content or the lesson
             methods. Large group lessons are generally conducted each morning of the training.

           </p>
           <p class="para  text-light-black line-h-166   mb-2">In the afternoon of each day, teachers are then
             required to practice the same or a similar lesson (with the help of the Teacher’s Guidebook as
             a reference) amongst smaller groups of their peers (between 5-20) who will conduct a peer
             evaluation for each practice lesson. In this sense, the training requires each teacher to not
             only study and become an expert in DK history but also assimilate new methods of teaching,
             which emphasize student participation and interaction and greater opportunity for critical
             thinking, inquiry, and debate. The large group settings allow the teachers to express
             themselves in a classroom setting that they are familiar with (large classroom lectures), and
             the smaller group settings challenge the teachers to practice their lessons before their peers.
             The smaller group setting is important because it allows the teachers to interact and learn
             from each other. Peers will be asked by the faculty trainer to evaluate and comment on each
             teacher’s performance.

           <p class="para  text-light-black line-h-166 mb-4 pb-lg-3 mt-lg-3">While the aim is to have groups
             of the smallest number possible for the small group breakout sessions, at times the faculty
             trainers may have ‘small’ groups that exceed 15-20 teachers at one time. In these situations,
             the smaller classroom settings are still beneficial because teachers are able to interact with
             each other and every teacher is required to practice a lesson before their peers. Within each
             group of teachers, a faculty advisor will provide assistance on the delivery of the lesson and
             fill in any critical content knowledge gaps. However, it is important to mention that during
             the smaller group sessions, participants are charged with driving the educational experience.
             Faculty trainers are directed to facilitate the peer evaluations by providing their
             observations and input; however, the emphasis is on challenging the teachers to self and
             peer-evaluate. This exercise serves the dual purpose of allowing teachers to improve their
             lessons while also their understanding of their role as professionals. In effect, they
             experience what it is like to take charge of one’s own learning, which facilitates their
             appreciation for student-centered learning methods. Finally, it is important to mention that
             throughout the training, the teachers are instructed in a variety of different methods. Small
             group discussions, team exercises, pair-share, ‘socratic questioning’, jigsaw, and K-W-L
             exercises are just a few of the types of methods that teachers are taught, modeled, and
             ultimately asked to perform before their peers.
