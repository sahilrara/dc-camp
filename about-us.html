                    <h1 class="sub-para text-4B4B4B">The Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam) uses four databases
                        to catalog
                        our
                        documentary materials and to facilitate our research. Much of the information in these databases
                        comes from our archives, which contain hundreds of thousands of pages of documents related to
                        the Khmer Rouge and the history of Democratic Kampuchea between April 1975 and January 1979. We
                        have collected documents from Tuol Sleng museum, the Cambodian Ministry of Interior, the
                        National Archives, and a number of other sources, and our staff has catalogued hundreds of
                        thousands of pages. Our archives include many documents from the 1975-79 period, including
                        official Khmer Rouge correspondence, biographies of Party members and arrested persons, prisoner
                        confessions, notebooks of Khmer Rouge cadres, photos of Party cadres, films, tape recordings,
                        Party magazines, other publications, and maps of Democratic Kampuchea. We also hold materials
                        dating from the pre-1975 period, including documents from the Lon Nol regime, and from the
                        post-1979 era, such as interview transcripts from survivors of the regime, victim petitions from
                        the 1982-83 period, and many other written or recorded materials </h1>

                        biographic, bibliographic, photographic, and geographic databases. These four databases are
                        DC-Cam’s authorized copies of the Cambodian Genocide Databases, which are copyrighted property
                        of Yale University’s Cambodian Genocide Program (CGP). The Cambodian Genocide Databases are the
                        products of collaboration between DC-Cam, the CGP, and the University of New South Wales. In
                        1995, the CGP founded DC-Cam as a field office in Phnom Penh, and we began work on document and
                        data collection and entry, sending files to the University of New South Wales for entry into the
                        databases pursuant to a sub-contracting agreement between the CGP and UNSW. DC-Cam became an
                        independent Cambodian institute in 1997 and continued to collaborate closely with CGP and UNSW
                        on development of the databases until our formal program drew to a successful conclusion in
                        September 2001. Together, we collected, catalogued and entered 2,963 bibliographical records,
                        10,690 biographical records, 5,190 photographs from the former Tuol Sleng Prison, and a wealth
                        of geographic information on the locations of mass graves, genocide memorials, and former Khmer
                        Rouge prisons in Cambodia. </h1>

                        Cambodia. DC-Cam has created a detailed, accurate map of KR security offices, killing sites, and
                        mass graves, as well as Cambodia’s genocide memorials. The mapping project aims to map and
                        detail all genocide sites, and serves as a crucial resource for historical research and legal
                        inquiry. Based on an ISIS search engine, each database functions separately and can be searched
                        for biographic, bibliographic, photographic, and geographic information. The biographic database
                        contains biographies of Khmer Rouge personnel as well as prisoners. The bibliographic database
                        lists Khmer Rouge documents, and references, books, and research papers about the Khmer Rouge
                        era. The photographic database can be searched for photos of Tuol Sleng (S-21) prisoners and
                        Khmer Rouge personnel. The geographic database contains location information and figures and
                        accounts of mass graves, prisons, and memorials. </h1>
